# GammaPP

### Intro

Multi-display supported gamma adjustment tools. 

Inspired by HotKey-Gamma, I re-implemented it with C++ for better support for multi-screen users.

### Usage

Press Ctrl + \[ to decrease gamma (min value: -1)

Press Ctrl + \] to increase gamma (max value: +1)

Press Ctrl + \\ to reset gamma

Press Alt + \\ to switch between displays
